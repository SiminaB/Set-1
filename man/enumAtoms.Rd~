\title{
  Enumerates atoms resulting from all the possible intersections and set
  differences of existing sets.
}
\description{
  Function inputs a list of sets or a binary matrix representing gene
  membership in sets and outputs a list of atoms resulting from all the
  possible intersections and set
  differences of existing sets.
}
\usage{
enumAtoms(S, rows.sets = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{S}{
    List of sets or a binary matrix representing gene
    membership in sets.
  }
  \item{rows.sets}{
    If \code{TRUE} and \code{S} is a matrix, then the rows of \code{S}
    represent the sets and the columns represent the sets.
    If \code{FALSE} and \code{S} is a matrix,
    then the rows of \code{S}
    represent the genes and the columns represent the sets.
  }
}
\value{
  List of atoms created by taking all possible intersections and set
  differences of existing sets.
